# L1

There are two interpreters:
1. `interpret` simply evaluates the program and prints the value once it
   terminates
2. `verbose_interpret` prints every evaluation step 

Currently, there are only two examples. Please make a PR if you want to add more.

To run the examples

```bash
cd bin
dune exec example1
```
